# Sustainability-of-Networking

This repository contains all the code used to conduct the research for developing an adaptive strategy aimed at reducing the carbon footprint of deep learning neural network models.

- The directories **Compression_Test_CNN** and **Compression_Test_MLP** contain the code and models used to evaluate the effectiveness of different compression techniques (pruning and Quantization-Aware Training, QAT) for CNNs and MLPs, respectively.
- The directories **Simulation_CNN** and **Simulation_MLP** include the scripts required to run the energy-aware inference simulations for the CNN and MLP models.
- The directories **CNN_3** and **MLP_3** contain smaller CNN and MLP architectures designed to evaluate the effectiveness of implementing an adaptive strategy on lightweight models compared to larger, more complex models.
